# ModaLoop
üõçÔ∏è ModaLoop is a minimalist React web application designed to showcase and sell stylish clothing products online. The website provides users with a smooth shopping experience, including browsing product listings, viewing detailed descriptions, adding items to a shopping cart, and seeing a live total of their selected items.

This is a practice project built using React and Redux Toolkit to explore key concepts of modern frontend development. The app features a functional shopping cart system where users can:

- Add products to the cart
- Increase or decrease product quantities
- Remove items individually
- View the total cart value
- Toggle a side drawer cart interface

All cart data is persisted in localStorage, and useEffect hooks are used to trigger updates like total calculation and side effects. The app is intentionally kept simple in design to focus on learning state management, component structure, and Redux reducer logic.

üí° Features:

- State management with Redux Toolkit
- LocalStorage cart persistence
- Real-time total price calculation
- Responsive cart drawer using MUI
- Clean, minimal UI for focus on logic

Perfect for beginners looking to understand how React and Redux work together in real-world applications.
